# E-Commerce Website with Django

This is a Django-based e-commerce website project. It allows users to browse products, manage their cart, and perform various e-commerce operations. This README will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following:

- Python 3.x
- MySQL database installed on your machine

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other projects, create a new virtual environment.

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 2. Clone the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hami-611/E-commerce_Website_using_Django.git
cd your-repository
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install MySQL Client
Since the project uses MySQL as the database, you need to install the MySQL client.

```bash
# Install MySQL client
pip install mysqlclient
```

Ensure that you have MySQL installed and configured on your machine.

### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment before running the project.

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 6. Database Migrations
Run the database migrations to set up your database tables.

```bash
# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 7. Create a Superuser (Optional)
If you want to access the admin panel, create a superuser.

```bash
# Create a superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create your admin account.

### 8. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server to test the project.

```bash
# Run the server
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to view the website.

### 9. Additional Configurations
Make sure to update your `settings.py` for MySQL database connection and other project-specific configurations.
